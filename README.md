## Vermintide 1
Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide exist two distinct framework namely [Vermintide Mod Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/vermintide/mods/1?tab=files) and [Quality Of Life Modpack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/7vk92o/110_quality_of_life_modpack_v15_cheatfree_w/). Besides the difference in the core and structure both frameworks accomplish the same purpose: modifying and improving the vanilla experience.  

For modders and users who want localization for mods, ease of use and installation, the Vermintide Mod Framework becomes handy in accomplishing these things. The Quality Of Life Framework however has a less complex structure, no UI for the mod loading purpose and might require more steps than drag and drop a single file by the user in order to install a mod.

## Vermintide 2
For Warhammer: Vermintide 2 exists only the [Vermintide Mod Framework](https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/#/README) that is accompanied by some very useful tools to develop mods.
