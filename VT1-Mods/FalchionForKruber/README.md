## Description:
Allows Kruber to wield Saltzpyre's falchion.

## Installation:
- download and unzip the [FalchionForKruber.zip](../../../../releases/tag/FalchionForKruber) archive
- copy *FalchionForKruber.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\
- copy *DoubleBlockNoPushFix.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\

## How to use:
Simply open the inventory and equip an existing falchion.

## Note:
~~This mod will crash any player in the lobby, which doesn't have this mod installed.~~
~~Thus it is highly advised to play in private lobbies or let all joining players install the mod.~~

The current implementation now allows it to be used when hosting or playing as a client.

If a Kruber bot uses a loadout with a falchion, then said bot can also wield it in battle.
