## Description:
This mod allows pausing the game on a key press.  
When a host pauses the game, then all clients freeze too.  
If a client attempts to pause the game, then only the said client will be paused while the other peers won't be affected.

Mod options are found under Shenanigans.

## Installation:
- copy *PauseGame.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\
- copy *pause_game.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\action

## Note:
Do **NOT** open the main menu while the game is paused, otherwise you'll be stuck there.
