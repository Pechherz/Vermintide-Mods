## Description:
This mod allows pausing the game on a key press.  
When a host pauses the game, then all clients freeze too.  
If a client attempts to pause the game, then only the said client will be paused while the other peers won't be affected.

Mod options are found under Shenanigans.

## Installation:
- copy *PauseGame.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\
- copy *pause_game.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\action\

## Note:
Do **NOT** click on any button in the main menu while the game is paused, otherwise you'll be stuck there.  

If your game doesn't pause properly after pressing a key, then there might be a conflict with an outdated version of DisconnectResilience.lua.  
You can either put the file DisconnectResilience.lua within a subfolder to disable it once the game is restarted or  
update your file with a [compatible version](./optional/DisconnectResilience.lua).
