## Description:
This is an alternative item spawner that is similar to the item spawner from Vermintide 2.  
It features predefined item groups (e.g. all, healing, bombs, potions ..) and a custom group, which can be adjusted by the player.  
Additionally players can iterate through the selected item group and spawn the currently choosen item.  

Its supposed to be a general improvement over the already existing item spawner, where every distinct item has a unique key.

## Installation:
- copy the file AlternativeItemSpawner.lua to .\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\
- copy the folder alternative_item_spawner_action to .\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\action\
