## Description:
This is a merge of [No Silent Assassins](https://www.nexusmods.com/vermintide/mods/40) and specials_spawn_idling to enable both mods simultaneously.  
Addtionally this mod exposes all settings from specials_spawn_idling to the mod settings.  

Some of the original functions that have been hooked by specials_spawn_idling were replaced by functions that force specials to hold position instead of not attacking the player.

Mod options are found under: **Game Menu → Options → Mod Settings → Gameplay Tweaks**

## Installation:
- download and unzip the [EnemyTweaks.zip](../../../../releases/tag/EnemyTweaks) archive
- copy *EnemyTweaks.lua* to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\patch\

## Note
This mod doesn't work properly with More Rat Weapons.
