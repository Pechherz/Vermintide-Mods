## Description:
A simple chat command to restart the current game.

## Installation:
- copy *restart.lua* to .\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\commands\
- add the following line to the file .\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\CommandList.lua: 
`{ "/restart", false, "commands", "restart" },`

## How to use:  
To restart a game simply open the chat box and type the following line:
```
/restart
```  
This will immediately reload the map for all players to start the game from anew.  
Beware that all progress made during the mission will not be accounted like in the *Defeat* screen, thus no player will receive any  
experience points.
