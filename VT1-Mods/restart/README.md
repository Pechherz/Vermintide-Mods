## Description:
Adds a chat command to restart the current game.

## Installation:
- copy *restart.lua* to .\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\commands\
- add the following line to the file .\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Warhammer End Times Vermintide\binaries\mods\CommandList.lua: 
`{ "/restart", false, "commands", "restart" },`

## How to use:  
To restart a game simply open the chat box and type the following line:
```
/restart
```  
This will immediately reload the map for the hosting player and all connected peers and everybody starts from anew.  
Beware that all progress made during mission progression will not be accounted like in the Defeat screen.
