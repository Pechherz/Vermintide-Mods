## Description:
This is an item spawner that aims to as convenient as the [Item Spawner](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1391975678) from Vermintide 2 and attempts to be a general improvement over the already existing VT1 item spawner mod, where every distinct item has a unique keybinding.  

The player can iterate through a selected item group and spawn a currently choosen item.  
It features predefined item groups like *All Items*, *Only Consumables*, *Only Loot Items*, objects and a custom group,  
which can be adjusted by the player.   

Mod options are found under *Cheats*.
